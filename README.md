### What I learned

Just some basic flexbox stuff but it's my first time using it.

body{
    background-color: #D5E1Ef;
    font-family: outfit;
    margin: 0px;
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
    flex-direction: column;
}

### Continued development

I definitely want to continue working on my flex box skills and also learning more CSS and HTML functions.

### Useful resources

- [Brocode CSS guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRNinF7YQqQ&t=2s) - Really simple and straightforward tutorial that helped me with all the basic CSS tools.
- [w3 schools for flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - This helped me to quickly learn flexboxes and how to use them as a centering tool.
